# MQTT Apache Camel component based on Eclipse MQTT Paho

The following project provides source for an Apache Camel component based on the MQTT Paho project of the Eclipse
Foundation (see https://eclipse.org/paho/). This component was developed as part of a study work, since the original
available MQTT camel component could not successfully communicate with the MQTT RSMB broker implementation.
